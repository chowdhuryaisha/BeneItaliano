            <h2>What We Do</h2>

            <p>Welcome to Bene Italiano, a traditional Italian boutique where men and woman alike can come and explore
                the wonderous quality of fine Italian fabrics and leathers. Here at Bene Italiano, you have a wide array
                of clothing to choose from, such as dresses, leather jackets, fine suits, shirts, pants and more
                perfectly tailored to your specifications.</p>

            <p>In 1968 my father Salvatore Bene founded this fine Italian boutique, with the goal of bringing the
                Italian fassion he grew up with in Sicily with him to America and sharing his culture with the people of
                his new found home. As a man with a passion for fashion he chose to use only the finest materials when
                creating his clothing, starting off with a small sewing machine and doing most of the work by hand.
                After his death in 2015, I, Enzo Bene have taken over to continue my fathers legacy of making high
                quality <i>Abbigliamento Italiano</i>.</p>

            <p>We understand that what you wear is a representation of yourself thats why we offer a custom and
                luxurious experience throughout your journy to creating that perfect suit or dress for that
                special
                occasion.</p>
